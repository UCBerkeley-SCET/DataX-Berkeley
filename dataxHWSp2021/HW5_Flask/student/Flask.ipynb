    "1. Because of the limitation of Free Heroku App, the demo website will sleep after becoming idle for a while. If that happens, it may take some time to restart the application after you have reached the site, so be patient with the website loading. After the website is back on, it should respond fast to your requests.\n",
    "2. For this homework, we store the website contents with a serverless [SQLite database](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) because it is easy to get started with. Because SQLite is also used for the demo website, the database states does not retain over time on Heroku's [ephemeral filesystem](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#ephemeral-filesystem). To resolve this issue or to scale up the web application, other production-ready database systems such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.heroku.com/postgres) should be used. While this issue will not affect the development on your local machine, it is important to keep the limitation of SQLite in mind."
